# Ideal Tech 

The app basically was to solve the Hiring problem of the Firm and help the recruiters and the job seekers. For the Job Seekers it showed all the available job positions in the firm and also help them apply for the position. Adding to it, it also has a quiz feature to prepare them for the Interview asked in the Hiring process.For the Recruiters this was a good medium to advertise all the available job positions and help them to hire the right person effectively.
Our app was made using pure Android in the Back-End we used Fire Base Real-time Database and Fire Base Authentication.
